One of my goals for the upcoming year (and decade) is to begin blogging and publishing content. I have had my own domain for quite some time with some links to email or social media. Nothing really beyond that. I never quite got around to actually building a website. That has changed.

{% highlight python %}
# test function
def test :
    print('hello world!')
{% endhighlight %}
