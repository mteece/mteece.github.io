For over a decade I have had my own personal domain registered at matthewteece.com. I never quite got around to actually building a website or any content to go with it. To those who know me personally or professionally, one would consider this a rather trivial endevour with all the technical skills and knowledge I have. I guess it was just not a priority during that time.

{% highlight python %}
# test function
def test :
    print('hello world!')
{% endhighlight %}

All things considered, I would like to change that. One of my goals for the upcoming year of 2020 is to start writing and publishing content on a semi-regular basis. I will focus on a myriad of topics, and I would like to contribute to some technical knowldge sharing based on experience.
