Look anywhere on the internet and there are hundreds of thousands developers, agencies, vendors, tutorials, training, books, and content on how to build a mobile app for iOS or Android. I was thinking about this the other day. There is this litany of material on releasing and shipping mobile apps, but little content on how to maintain mobile apps on either platform.

Like any software on the desktop, or web. Mobile apps do have a shelf life. It might be much longer than you think. A few I have worked on stretch back to 2015 (when Swift was released) and are still being maintained. A quick search on [Objective-C jobs](https://www.google.com/search?q=objective-c+jobs) even yields some surprising demand. I can only assume from some of the longevity of these apps over 5-10 years.

I would like to explore the post release experience of apps, and share some tips on how to maintain them over a series of posts the next few months.
