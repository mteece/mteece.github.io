In my orginal post {% post_url 2020-01-01-hello-world %} I outlined my intent to write and publish content for the first time throughout the year of 2020. Then COVID-19, caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, started to spread in the United States. Between January and March of 2020 life changed dramatically.

The most immediate impact to myself, spouse, and children was the closing of in-person school and on premise daycare. At the same time in early March we had just obtained an Individualized Education Program (IEP) for our 6 year old. I was fortunate to be working in the technology sector in a remote role, but my spouse had a disruptive start and had to adapt from traveling with regional sales.

The school district went fully virtual with a "bring your own device" (BYOD) approach. We had just purchased a Chromebook for our oldest over the holiday so we did not have to share a work computer with her or vice versa. Suffice to say, having to share a work computer would have been even more daunting. The jump to virtual school was necessary, but also very disorganized. For our 6 year old, sitting on Zoom for 1st grade without much structure was a challenge. Let alone everything related to her IEP.

For the first 90 days between March and June we struggled. Trying to juggle schedules with work, school, boundries, meetings, and entertaining a 3 year old really took its toll. The isolation, daily friction, and work expectations not aligning with the reality of obligations was even more stressful. How do you stay employed, while at the same time home-school a child? As time wore on we eventually made attempts to connect with close friends / family in the area with kids the same age. Those attempts bore an eventual idea where we all unite and share the burden.

Come June, as virtual kindergarten spun down, we contacted a former daycare staff member to see if they would be interested in summer work. We began to lay the groundwork for an isolated group, a teacher, and a house rotation for the summer. Eventually we formed what we called a Covid-Pod (Pod). Each week there is a host family, lunches made, drop off in the morning, pick up in the afternoon, and a general structure to the day run by the teacher. Structurally a contract was written up to ensure proper fiancial expectations, payroll, holidays, and COVID-19 outbreaks within the group.

We're fortunate as this has allowed us safe socialization for children and adults alike. Amongst the chaos we have some sense of normalcy. Since the summer, the Covid-Pod has evolved with another family joining, and a new teacher brought onboard. Including her own daughter to the group. Virtual school began again, much better planned and prepared. 

As we adapt and shift gears into 2021, I will be more diligent about writing and sharing.
