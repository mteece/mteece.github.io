I didn't realize it until I booked the appointment, but as soon as Phase 1B of New Hampshire's vaccinations were open I took the earliest slot I could get. Ironically 09:45 AM April 1, 2021. My spouse and I were so excited the morning of. Even waiting in the mass vaccination site line for 1.5 hours right up to injection time. Turns out we got Moderna, shot number 1.

As we waited for the National Guard and local EMT's. I joked with the gentlemen performing the inoculation.

> You sure this isn't some placebo April Fools' injection right?

We had a good laugh, scheduled the next injection, and were well on our way to the 15 minute wait area and then home.

I'll admit it was quite a surreal experience. National Guard, long lines, tents, etc. My spouse was even wondering when Matt Damon would come out of nowhere reminding us this was all a film set.

We are fortunate to have made it to this stage. For those that were not and have lost loved ones during this pandemic. I hope you find peace.
